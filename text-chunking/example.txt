Project: Payment Platform Revamp
Ticket: PAY-1023
Type: Story
Priority: High
Status: In Progress
Assignee: John Tan
Reporter: Alice Lim

Description:
The payment platform currently supports credit card and FPX payments only.
As part of the Q2 initiative, the system must be enhanced to support additional
payment methods including e-wallets such as GrabPay, Touch 'n Go, and Boost.

The backend service is implemented using Spring Boot 3.2 with Java 17.
The frontend is built using React JS version 18 and communicates with the backend
via REST APIs secured using OAuth 2.0.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. User should be able to select an e-wallet during checkout.
2. Payment request must be routed to the correct payment gateway.
3. System must handle payment callback asynchronously.
4. Payment status must be updated within 5 seconds.
5. Audit logs must be created for all payment transactions.

Technical Notes:
- The payment-service communicates with the wallet-service using Kafka.
- Topic name: payment.wallet.request
- Partition key: transactionId
- Retry policy: exponential backoff with max 3 retries.
- Dead-letter topic: payment.wallet.dlt

The wallet-service integrates with external providers via HTTPS.
All requests must be signed using HMAC-SHA256.
Secrets are stored in HashiCorp Vault and injected at runtime.

Project: Payment Platform Revamp
Ticket: PAY-1041
Type: Bug
Priority: Medium
Status: Open
Assignee: Sarah Lee
Reporter: Michael Wong

Description:
Users reported intermittent failures when making FPX payments during peak hours.
Error logs indicate timeout exceptions occurring at the bank adapter layer.

Stack trace excerpt:
java.net.SocketTimeoutException: Read timed out
    at java.base/sun.nio.ch.NioSocketImpl.timedRead(NioSocketImpl.java:288)
    at java.base/sun.nio.ch.NioSocketImpl.implRead(NioSocketImpl.java:314)

The issue seems to occur when concurrent transactions exceed 500 TPS.
Load testing was performed using JMeter with a ramp-up period of 10 minutes.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. FPX payments must succeed under 1000 TPS.
2. Timeout threshold should be configurable.
3. Proper error message must be returned to frontend.
4. System should auto-retry failed transactions where applicable.

Proposed Fix:
- Increase connection pool size.
- Enable HTTP keep-alive.
- Add circuit breaker using Resilience4j.
- Improve monitoring using Prometheus and Grafana.

Project: Analytics Platform
Ticket: ANA-331
Type: Story
Priority: Low
Status: Done
Assignee: Daniel Ng
Reporter: Product Team

Description:
The analytics platform aggregates transaction data for reporting purposes.
Data is ingested from multiple sources including payment-service, wallet-service,
and order-service.

Currently, data is processed in batch mode every 24 hours.
The goal is to support near real-time analytics with a maximum delay of 1 minute.

Technical Approach:
- Use Apache Kafka Streams for real-time aggregation.
- Store intermediate results in Redis.
- Persist final aggregates in PostgreSQL.
- Expose metrics via REST endpoint /api/v1/analytics/summary

Security Considerations:
- Sensitive fields such as card number must be masked.
- Access to analytics endpoints must be restricted to admin users.
- JWT tokens must be validated for each request.
